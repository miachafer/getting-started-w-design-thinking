## Introduction to Design Thinking

**What is Design Thinking?**
* Design thinking is a customer-centric approach to determining how best to meet customer needs.
* It was popularized in the 1990's by global design company IDEO and by Stanford School of Design, and applicable across industries.

**Design Thinking teams must:**
* adopt customer centric approach
* cultivate empathy
* accept ambiguity
* embrace and leverage failure

**Stanford's five step framework for design thinking.**
1. Empathizing with customers to better understand them.
2. Defining problems from the customer's perspective. 
3. Ideation, which involves moving beyond the obvious and brainstorming possible solutions. 
4. Prototyping: building and assessing models can help organizations and their users assess, adapt, and rework a solution quickly and easily. 
5. Testing prototypes by getting feedback from real users.
   1. Circle back through the design thinking cycle. 
   2. Using what they've learned from the users feedback, to refine the next iteration of the solution. 

## Empathizing with Customers

* **Beginner's mindset**: Move beyond established or preconceived ideas of how a product or process should work. Instead, try to exist in a state of pure observation free from bias or judgment. 
* **Look out from the inside**: Experience the situation from the customer’s point of view. 
* **Acknowledge the customer's story**: determine the background or context from which costumers arrive. 

## Defining Problems from the Customer's Perspective

Once an organization has an empathetic understanding of its customers and their needs, it's time to **reframe the problem**. This involves defining the **design challenge from the customer's perspective**. 

**The reframing process includes five main steps:**
1. Review its empathetic observations about their customers.
2. Determine what has been learned and based on the information that was collected and provide a clear definition or a profile of the customer that they aim to assist. 
3. Articulate this customer's unmet need.
4. Provide a meaningful and actionable problem statement called the point of view or POV. The POV should consist of a few sentences that capture the following points:
   1. Who is the customer? 
   2. What are the customer's needs? 
   3. Why is a new product or service design required to address these needs?
5.  Reframe the problem using the POV. Let the POV shape the way they view every aspect of their work going forward.

## Brainstorming Customer-centric Solutions

Once a business knows what problem it needs to solve from their customer's point of view, it's time to start generating solutions.

**To ensure brainstorming is focused and productive, it's important to follow certain guidelines:**
* The project team should be diverse and cross functional
* It should be quiet and comfortable so participants don't get distracted. 
* There must be adequate resources available for everyone to participate in the discussion. 
* It's also a good idea to set and stick to a clear time limit.
* The aim of brainstorming is quantity rather than quality. 
  * No idea should be considered to far fetched or unusual at this early stage. 

## Prototyping to Visualize Solutions

Once a business has identified potential solutions to a problem, it's time to start thinking of ways to assess how beneficial they could be for their existing products or services.

**A prototype is a low resolution demonstration of an idea** that's used to elicit feedback from customers and colleagues, before final production.

## Testing and Refining Solutions

Testing can be undertaken throughout the entire design-thinking process, although it's most commonly performed in conjunction with the prototyping phase. 

It involves **generating user feedback about the prototypes** a team has created and gaining a deeper understanding of the customer.

**Best practices of the testing phase:**
* It's important to test early and as often as possible. 
* Remember that the whole point of the testing phase is to keep from becoming too invested in ideas that could potentially prove unsuccessful.
* It’s also fundamental to set test objectives. 
  * Finding out exactly what the business needs to learn about the tested solution, and then let that guide the rest of the design-thinking process.
* Test ideas on the target audience directly.  
  * Assemble a group that's as representative as possible of the target audience with members who can articulate their thoughts clearly.
* The results of the test must be collected in an environment that's as close to a real-life setting as possible.
* Participants must figure things out for themselves, without being told what to expect or how to feel.
* After the testing sessions are complete, it's essential to review the results.
  * Companies can then use that knowledge to improve further prototypes, based on the customer's feedback, and test again.
* The process is repeated over and over in the design cycle until a product or a service is developed that best meets customers' needs and wants.
